== Description ==
WP ADA Compliance Check is the most comprehensive web accessibility solution for WordPress. Trusted by thousands of small business, government and educational institution websites to comply with Section 508 and WCAG 2.2 LEVEL A/AA Web Accessibility Standards. Our WordPress Web Accessibility plugin includes 81 individual error checks, far more than comparable solutions. It evaluates content for Web Accessibility issues anywhere on your website. It integrates seamlessly into your workflow, evaluating your website for Web Accessibility issues when content is published or you can run a complete scan of your website to identify issues in all of your content. Accessibility reports provide references and easy to follow instructions. No other solution compares in ease of use. The basic version is limited to 15 posts or pages during full scans, has a smaller rule set (52 error checks) and is unable to identify issues found in theme files. The full version corrects many common issues automatically using convenient, time saving filter options built into the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why use the WP ADA Compliance Plugin? =

It’s the law! In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. This law applies to all Federal agencies, some state and local agencies as well as any entity creating websites for applicable agencies.

In recent years, there has been an increase of website accessibility lawsuits. In some states the rulings have indicated that business websites failing to meet WCAG guidelines are in violation of Title III of the ADA.

There is also a strong business case for accessibility. Studies show that accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, and increased audience reach. All of which increases profit margin for a business. 

= What issues does WP ADA Compliance Check Basic check for? =

The WP ADA Compliance Plugin evaluates content for the most common issues typically found on your website. As Web Accessibility standards evolve the plugin is continually updated to include the latest requirements.

[Visit our website to compare versions and review a complete list of features and issues that are evaluated](https://www.wpadacompliance.com/) 

= Can WP ADA Compliance Check Basic scan all of my content? =

= How do I troubleshoot 500, 502 or 504 Server Errors During Scans? =

These errors normally occur while scanning pages with a large number of links. If you see server errors, increase the PHP max_execution_time to at least 300 and memory_limit to 256MB or 700MB for PDF scans. It may be necessary to increase the max_execution_time and memory_limit even further if errors persist.
